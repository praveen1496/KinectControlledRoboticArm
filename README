The code for Arduino is in Arduino Sketch folder. This code receives the data from processing IDE and calcualtes the angles for the servo motors in Robotic arm.
The code for Processing IDE is in Processing Sketch folder. Please run Processing version 2.2.1. That supports Xbox 360 Kinect.

Run both Arduino and Processing simulataneously and execute Processing IDE.
The output window will display what Kinect can see. If there is user in the front, you can see the joint points and skeleton structure.
As you move your arm, the angles will be calculated and sent to the arduino board in the robotic arm.
