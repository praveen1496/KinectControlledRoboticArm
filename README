# KINECT CONTROLLED ROBOTIC ARM

### Tools used: Processing IDE and ARDUINO
### Kinect used: Xbox 360 version (NOT Xbox ONE)

Run both Arduino and Processing simulataneously and execute Processing IDE.
The output window will display what Kinect can see. If there is user in the front, you can see the joint points and skeleton structure.
As you move your arm, the angles will be calculated and sent to the arduino board in the robotic arm.
